*q3 - bad auton , didn't understand **LOADING FAIL**
*q13 - low traffic - ironically probably close to our best performance despite the ending. We had the cube for 5th, but we know how it ends **DRIVE FAIL**
*q19 - we bump our own dude off the platform, but they should have tipped it for us, penalty - we got 4 on our own, we were the reason we were even in this match
*q26 - 4 pieces placed, one in auton, could have had 5 potentially
*q32 - 4 pieces placed, one in auton, solid match - very shake this match due to injury
*q37 - clearly we were nearly broken in this match, but we still placed 3 pieces, one in auton (made a link)
q45 - unplugged at 60s, 2 total game pieces, 1 from auto **MECHANICAL FAIL**
*q49 -4 total cones, 1 from auto (not coincidentally with our future lead picker)
q56 - wow, bad pickup - missed auto, dropped one cone, failed last pickup - 1 placed! **AUTO FAIL**
q64 - unplugged self early - very sad **MECHANICAL FAIL**
*q68 - some brutal loading, still got 4
q78 - brutal loading? 2 game pieces **LOADING FAIL**
* semis 1 - got 3, should have had 4, but auto failed due to select **AUTO**
* semis 2 - got 4, one in auto
* semis 3 - got 3, one in auto, were murdered at 54s while on the way to get #4
* semis 4 - got 4, one in auto
semis 5 - got 2, one in auto - got stuck with cone loading **ITEM STUCK**

https://www.thebluealliance.com/match/2023midet_qm20 -- great example of how quickly we should be able to pick up

11-15 seconds to grab cone x 3
11-15 seconds to get across field x 4
5-7 seceonds to place once in
5-10 seconds to balance when things are good

135 110 85 60 35 -- for a total of 6 links, plenty of time to do another/balance

almost 35 seconds a cycle - if we can cut down to 12 seconds to cross, and 5 seconds to pick up, and 5 seconds to place, we could
get to 6 game total pieces pretty easily (plus balance) for a total of 40 in grid, 12+6+3 in auto (21), 10 at the end? 71 points total

### Alliance Negotiation
* Stay in lane, or negotiate another strategy such as flow
* Get four links

Defense tips:
* Early on knock cubes/cones out of their grasp (don't hit attachments)
* Leave their area at 30 seconds, not worth it

### Coaching
THE BIGGEST THING IS TO APPROACH THE GAME PIECES SLOWLY.
DO A REVIEW OF HOW THE STATION WORKS WITH BOTH DRIVERS SO THEY KNOW HOW TO LINE UP

### Things to keep track of:
* Finishing links, staying slow on the charging station
* If we need two or three to balance to get a ranking point
* with 35 seconds left
    * Finish a link?
    * Balance?
    * Impede opponent (from getting back to balance)

### General picking strategy
* When deciding between teams that can score 4-6 look for solid auto, balancing, swerve
* When deciding between defense, pick quick and aggressive
* For two "below top notch (and a third)" teams to make it to the final 3/4, it is best to nail your auto and balance
* Having someone who will play good defense is of course wonderful to have
* But having two decent cone scorers and one decent cube scorer, is also good

### Scoring

### Alliance Scoring
* 17 - Captain spot (if you're rank 1, you get 16 points. Basically a minimum of 9 points)
* 17 - Draft spot (so, if you were the #2 pick, you get 15 points. Basically, so long as you're either a captain or in the first round, you're getting 9-16 points)

#### Playoffs
