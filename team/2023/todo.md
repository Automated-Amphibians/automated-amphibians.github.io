#### Must be done before driving
* CAD+Build: Add chain drive and motor to robot 
    * [Build max-planetary drive with the NEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3uNb1OkXao&t=2115s) Ignore the bits about how they will be installed on the robot
* Build: Add Hardstops
    * [Attach U-Bolts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3frFlVkLmc&list=PLrna2STRqYY87NvF51rnfGlbh-su3NSHM&index=32&t=137s). 
        * One at the back of the elbows, the other at some arbitrary point in the superstructure that allows 
    * [Add nylon cord as hard stops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3frFlVkLmc&list=PLrna2STRqYY87NvF51rnfGlbh-su3NSHM&index=32&t=3126s)
    * Add badge clips too
    * This step needs a high level of customization! Please get mentor Chris
* Build: [Wire the intake motor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tk_cv8Iqrs&list=PLrna2STRqYY87NvF51rnfGlbh-su3NSHM&index=35&t=12554s)
* Build: [Add surgical tubing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3frFlVkLmc&list=PLrna2STRqYY87NvF51rnfGlbh-su3NSHM&index=31&t=4724s)
* Build: [Add driver chain to the side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rltMrhk1spM&list=PLrna2STRqYY87NvF51rnfGlbh-su3NSHM&index=30&t=98s)
* Build: Straighten arms (use tubing may be all that's necessary)
* Build: Add stopper at legal point (3d print breakaway?), add foam for back to avoid breakage
* Build: Battery container for the rolling toolchest
* Build: Wire battery charger


#### ASAP

* CAD+Build: Design in Weight/Ballasts
* Build: Cut up the allen wrench to be able to work on tight fitting swerve screw
* Competition Prep: Who will be taking care of?
    * Batteries
    * Inspecting and fixing wiring
    * Inspecting and fixing mechanical
* Competition Prep: Who are the five reps on the field
    * Two drivers, a drive coach, human player, and technician
* Competition Prep: Figure out how we are going to transport robot on game day
* Coding: add 180 capability
* Coding: turn while extended prevention
* Coding: Fix field driving
* Coding: Code/Test braking
* Coding: Create ability to X on stop
* Marketing: Design tension plate logos/team customizations
    * Now we need to put it on the robot
* Build: Add some type of endstop (for fully reversed or extended) or an encoder to detect arm position

#### Not doing
* Build: [Grind down/cut motor shaft?](https://youtu.be/cAuw28GBfac?t=6659) -- we will skip this -- hopefully do not regret

#### Can be done immediately, but are not the priority
* Bumper/Chassis -- Design plan to add carrying handles 
* Build: Add camera?
* Build: [Add double game element carry protection](https://youtu.be/HqV5bPj1rbc?t=1246)

#### Cannot be completed without more information, parts or other steps complete
* Coding: Autonomous mode - in and out of zone
* Coding: Shuffleboard, select autonomous mode
* Coding: Autonomous mode - run up the ramp and break

#### Extras
* Plug Absolute Encoder into Alternate Encoder - https://docs.revrobotics.com/sparkmax/operating-modes/alternate-encoder-mode
* Robot Cart - Design an Upgrade 

### Administration
* Can be done immediately    
    * Mentors Sign Up (Novi):
        * https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuUMT7yH1jrWJqEtLaOg5G5JPKdHvIqM7CDjPb8UslOHR1eA/viewform    
    * Update financials based on what Janelle sent and new orders 
    * Need to track volunteering
* Watching
    * FORMS: FIRST Registation/Waivers (two are left)
    * FORMS: Event forms? FIRST of michigan specific Waivers?
    * FORMS: Forms to Ashley about Transportation - for anyone that needs a ride
* Waiting on Other Tasks
    * (AFTER FEE IS DONE) Novi Medical Waivers for Event
* For later
    * Get setup for Volunteering Days Required (2 8 hour days for 2 people (or 32 hours -- or 16 half days if we get to 16 volunteers to build an arena))
        * https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#search/volunteerin/FMfcgzGrbvHZDrzDJRjNCjNHWDSHgZTk
    * COMPETITION: Send transportation information to Ashley (SENT) 
        * More paperwork, paperwork, paperwork.
        * https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/KtbxLxghjbDfXVxWZXHlFSZhCWPpnqjlDB?compose=new


### Coding Preparation/General
* ~~[Learn Java Basics](tutorials/java)~~
* [Learning FRC Java](tutorials/frc-java)
* [GIT Tutorials](tutorials/git) (2 of 5 required have completed)
* Coding: Talk about how drivetrain, swervemodules, kinematics and odometry all work together
