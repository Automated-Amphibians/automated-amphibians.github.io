#### Must be done before driving
* CAD+Build: Add chain drive and motor to robot 
* Build: [Add tension wires with adjusters](https://youtu.be/rltMrhk1spM?t=7062), [also](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3frFlVkLmc&list=PLrna2STRqYY87NvF51rnfGlbh-su3NSHM&index=32&t=2301s)
* Build: [Grind down/cut motor shaft](https://youtu.be/cAuw28GBfac?t=6659)
* Build: Add Hardstops
    * [Attach U-Bolts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3frFlVkLmc&list=PLrna2STRqYY87NvF51rnfGlbh-su3NSHM&index=32&t=137s). NOTE! U-bolts at top are already attached, skip those particular 
    * [Add nylon cord as hard stops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3frFlVkLmc&list=PLrna2STRqYY87NvF51rnfGlbh-su3NSHM&index=32&t=3126s)
    * Add badge clips too
    * This step needs a high level of customization! Please get mentor Chris
* Build: [Add surgical tubing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3frFlVkLmc&list=PLrna2STRqYY87NvF51rnfGlbh-su3NSHM&index=31&t=4724s)
* Build: [Wire the intake motor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Tk_cv8Iqrs&list=PLrna2STRqYY87NvF51rnfGlbh-su3NSHM&index=35&t=12554s)
* Build: [Add polywall to the intake](https://youtu.be/cAuw28GBfac?t=5149) -- you need to adjust the width because our robot is bigger
    * [Consider making the height bigger than 5ish inches](https://youtu.be/HqV5bPj1rbc?t=752)

#### ASAP
* CAD+Build: Design in Weight/Ballasts
* Build: Verify that we are in bounds - snip edges of robot?
* Build: Cut up the allen wrench to be able to work on tight fitting swerve screw
* Competition Prep: Who will be taking care of?
    * Batteries
    * Inspecting and fixing wiring
    * Inspecting and fixing mechanical
* Competition Prep: Who are the five reps on the field
    * Two drivers, a drive coach, human player, and technician
* Competition Prep: Figure out how we are going to transport robot on game day
* Coding: add 180 capability
* Coding: turn while extended prevention
* Coding: Fix field driving
* Coding: Code/Test braking
* Coding: Create ability to X on stop
* Marketing: Design tension plate logos/team customizations
    * Now we need to put it on the robot

#### Can be done immediately, but are not the priority
* Bumper/Chassis -- Design plan to add carrying handles 
* Build: [Add driver chain to the side](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rltMrhk1spM&list=PLrna2STRqYY87NvF51rnfGlbh-su3NSHM&index=30&t=98s)
* Build: Add camera?
* Build: [Add double game element carry protection](https://youtu.be/HqV5bPj1rbc?t=1246)

#### Cannot be completed without more information, parts or other steps complete
* Coding: Autonomous mode - in and out of zone
* Coding: Shuffleboard, select autonomous mode
* Coding: Autonomous mode - run up the ramp and break

#### 
* Plug Absolute Encoder into Alternate Encoder - https://docs.revrobotics.com/sparkmax/operating-modes/alternate-encoder-mode
* RobotCarrier - Design an Upgrade 
* Coding: Talk about how drivetrain, swervemodules, kinematics and odometry all work together
