#8 = 8/32 (versaframe)
#10 = 10/32 ()

0.125 = 1/8  - good thickness
0.062 = 1/16 - pretty thin - careful!
0.04  = 1/20 - very thin

* Measurement
    * Digital Calipers      
    * Tachometer
    * Multimeter

* Framing/Fasteners/Raw Materials
    * Square tubes -- https://www.revrobotics.com/MAXTube/ -- 2x1 (not light), grid pattern
        * Looks like we're just going to go with what FF has, we probably should still order from here.
        * 1x1 for cross bracing?
    * "Server Rack Screws" (motor mounts neo 1651) --  
    * Screws/Fasteners
        * 10-32, try to standardize on 1/4-20 and 10-32 sizes so you're not always searching for the exact right fastener (or tool that fits it).        
        * (Rivets work great for things like attaching gussets, we use 1000 a year) -- we have rivets
    * Polycarb/aluminum sheets - structural materials for custom mechanisms
