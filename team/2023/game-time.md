### Alliance Negotiation
* *Stay in lane* or negotiate another strategy such as flow
* Coopertition, Get four links
* We balance, two get on, we'll complete last minute links, or join you on

Defense tips:
* Early on knock cubes/cones out of their grasp (don't hit attachments)
* Leave their area at 30 seconds, not worth it

### Things to keep track of:
* Finishing links
* Getting the final balance arranged for ranking point
* 35 seconds left:
    * Balance?
    * Finish a link -- only if it is worth a ranking point    
    * Impede opponent (from getting back to balance)

### Coaching
* approach game pieces slowly, as we did in practice
* stay slow on the charging station
