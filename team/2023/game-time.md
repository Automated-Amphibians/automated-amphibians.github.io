### Alliance Negotiation
* Stay in lane, or negotiate another strategy such as flow
* Coopertition, Get four links
* We balance, two get on, we'll complete last minute links, or join you on

Defense tips:
* Early on knock cubes/cones out of their grasp (don't hit attachments)
* Leave their area at 30 seconds, not worth it

### Coaching
THE BIGGEST THING IS TO APPROACH THE GAME PIECES SLOWLY.
DO A REVIEW OF HOW THE STATION WORKS WITH BOTH DRIVERS SO THEY KNOW HOW TO LINE UP

### Things to keep track of:
* Finishing links, staying slow on the charging station
* If we need two or three to balance to get a ranking point
* with 35 seconds left
    * Finish a link?
    * Balance?
    * Impede opponent (from getting back to balance)
