### Requirements

* Attendance once a week from October until December
* Attendance twice a week throughout January (this is considered a bare minimum, for those who are part of the team)
* A $200 Team Fee which contributes to the team budget

You need to know why you are here, and probably should be able to explain what you are hoping to get out of it. 

* Not acceptable: I'm hoping to put this on a resume, I really need another activity for honors society.
* Acceptable: I'd like to gain experience and achieve something worth putting on a resume.

Additionally, you should understand that FRC is a commitment that will require at minimum a similar number of hours
to joing a high school sport. For short periods, FRC requires more than a sport. During the times we meet less than a 
HS sport, there is often learning that needs to be done outside of class in order to be prepared for more busy periods.

* Not acceptable: I'll make it once a week for the pre-season.
* Acceptable: I'm part of a team, I'll put in effort to be prepared to contribute to whatever the team needs, 
  whether it is building a robot or some other task.
