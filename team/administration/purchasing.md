### Reimbursement process
1. Make Purchase (you may get tax removed if you show the sales [Tax Exempt Form](2022 NCSD Sales Tax Exempt Form.pdf))
2. Fill out [Purchasing Form](8426 Check Request Form.xlsx) or via [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bmAzsNwdcWkRJ-D27S9e2H3M6aLKEFh1/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=109215338218990950446&rtpof=true&sd=true)

Hi Chris,

I’ve attached the check reimbursement form. I also uploaded it to the finance folder on the drive. If you or any of the other mentors make a purchase, your treasurer can submit the form for reimbursement. Complete the form, print to pdf and email to Ashley Bootz (ashley.bootz@novik12.org) along with scans of the original receipts. The district will send a check in about 2 weeks. Yes, the purchaser ends up “donating” the sales tax because the district won’t reimburse. So, this is good for smaller purchases that need to be made quickly.

The NCSD sales exempt form is also in the finance folder on the drive. If you’re making in person purchases, you can take it with you and request the sales tax be waived. The hassle factor varies by store. I think Home Depot on Grand River has the NCSD sales tax form on file if you tell them at check out that you’re purchasing for a Novi High School organization.

For larger online purchases like the swerve modules, Ashley will make payment with her district credit card. I try to limit these to larger amounts so we don’t nickel and dime her with lots of purchases from 50 teams!

I still need to request the POs for the team for AndyMark, REV and VEX for the build season. Honestly the district is still finishing the 2021/22 audit and I’m trying to space out my requests. But I’ll do that in the next couple of weeks so you have those in place before kickoff.

Hope this makes sense,

Janelle
