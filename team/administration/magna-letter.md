Magna,

My name is Manasa, and I’m a member of an all rookie FRC team Automated Amphibians #8426. We are looking to raise money in order to compete at a higher level for the 2023 FRC competition. As you may know, in FRC, teams of high school students, led by adult mentors, design, fabricate, build, and drive 120 pound robots to compete in new games every year.

We recognize and appreciate that Magna has a long standing commitment to supporting and working with FIRST teams in the Michigan area.
Our team is very new: We were founded in 2020, but due to covid only began competing in 2022. Previous members of 8426 placed in the top 10 of a competition last season but fell short of competing at states, which is now our goal.

Participating in FRC utilizes materials and hardware which can be expensive. For future competitions we’re looking to expand our competitiveness by purchasing swerve modules, motors and absolute encoders. The cost for these enhancements will be approximately $4,500. We’re hoping to reach the state level of competition this year, and are looking to raise $3000 for the registration fees. We have  also budgeted an additional $2,500 for display booth materials, tools, and meals while at competition. In order to create a team that is able to inspire students to accomplish great things, within and outside FIRST, we are looking to raise a total of $10,000 dollars for the season. 

We have four levels of sponsorship:
* **Bronze - $250 - $1,000** - Logo on website, other promotional materials 
* **Silver - $1,000 - $3,000** - Bronze level + Logo on website, robot, t-shirts
* **Gold - $5,000** - Silver level +  Pedestal stand display at competition
* **Platinum - $10,000 or greater** - Gold + Large banner, buttons at competition worn by team members

Every single dollar donated will get us closer to forming a competitive team, as well as inspiring future scientists and engineers. Whatever you are able to give, we are appreciative of. 

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely, 
Manasa

Automated Amphibians
