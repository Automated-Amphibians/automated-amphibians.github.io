Dear Magna,

My name is [Someone], and Iâ€™m a captain of an all rookie FRC team Automated Amphibians #8426. We are looking to raise money in order to form our team and compete in the 2023 FRC competition. FIRST is an international organization that aims to recognize engineers and scientists as heroes and idols for students, like sports stars and actors/actresses are now. In FRC, teams of high school students, led by adult mentors, design, fabricate, build, and drive 120 pound robots to compete in new games every year. 

We recognize and appreciate that Magna has a long standing commitment to supporting and working with FIRST teams in the Michigan area.

Our team is comprised of Freshmen with little to no experience with FRC. In order to succeed, we are utilizing existing designs like Everybot and leaning on our mentors heavily. As you know already know, FRC is an amazing opportunity for all students mentors and sponsors involved. 

Participating in FRC utilizes advanced hardware techniques and materials which can be expensive. For future competitions we're looking to expand our competitiveness by purchasing swerve modules, motors and absolute encoders. The cost for these enhancements will be in the range of $4,500. We're hoping to reach the state level of competition this year, and are looking to raise $3000 for the registration fees. We've also budgeted an additional $2,500 for meals while at competition, display booth materials, and tools. In order to create a team that is able to inspire students to accomplish great things, within and outside FIRST, we are looking to raise $10,000 dollars. We believe Magna can assist, not just by providing funding, but also guidance, mentorship, and inspiration, if you so choose.

Every single dollar donated will get us closer to forming a competitive team, as well as inspiring future scientists and engineers. Whatever you are able to give will give you our ever lasting appreciation, as well as the Magna logo on our website, t-shirt, banner, and robot, depending on the size of your contribution. We what you can do is help us recruit mentors, within Magna, and outside of it. Mentors are the lifeblood of any successful FRC team, and as our team is all rookie membership, we need them more than most. Their commitment can range from once a week to every day, and they can be engineers, programmers, or entirely non technical - all they need is an ember of interest. It would be of such assistance if you could forward the attached letter to anyone you think might be interested in this - non-technical or technical, retired or working, anyone at all.

To recap, we are a fledgling FRC team looking to raise $10,000 to get off the ground and teach kids the fundamentals of engineering, machining, and commitment. We would very much appreciate it if you sponsored us, either by providing money, or by providing space to work, tools, or mentors. I would love if my team could come tell you a little more about FIRST and ourselves. Can we schedule a meeting?

Sincerely,
[Someone]
