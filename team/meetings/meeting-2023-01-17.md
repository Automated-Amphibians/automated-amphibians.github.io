Planned:

1) Finishing the swerve modules
2) Crimping the motors and motor controllers with connectors
3) Creating a mount for a single swerve drive
4) Deploying our first motor controlling code to a motor

We do need to have a discussion about different navigational approaches and the pros and cons of those, as well as starting to think about what we want to do for the mechanism. There are tons of videos online, I'll probably start linking them during the week.
