This tutorial assumes you know the basics about Java. You should have a grasp on:

* What a class, method and statements are and how they are defined.
    * A class is a blueprint or template for a collection of variables in memory and methods/function contained by the instance.
* Variables and the basic primitive types (boolean, int, float, doubles, Strings, void, arrays)
* Expressions/Comparison 
* Methods, Parameters, Return Values, and why we use static
* Naming Conventions
* How to output a variable to the console (System.out.println())
* Loops
* The basics of inheritance and interfaces

This tutorial also assumes you have the FRC WPILib installed.

We need to keep in mind at times for this tutorial the general hierarchy of how code is organized.

* Libraries (.jars, sets of folders compressed into a single file)
    * Package (folder)
        * Class (file)
            * Method
                * Statement                
{:.bold-list}

If a java statements are lines in a book, java Methods are paragraphs (or pages), a java Class is a book, a package is a bookshelf, and a java Library is a building (aka, a library!).

We'll get a closer look at how to work with classes and packages later.
