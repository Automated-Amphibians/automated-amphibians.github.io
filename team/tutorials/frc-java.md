[This tutorial assumes you know the basics about Java already.](java)

[Retain more with the quiz](frc-java-quiz)

This tutorial also assumes you have the FRC WPILib installed.

We need to keep in mind at times for this tutorial the general hierarchy of how code is organized.

* Libraries (.jars, sets of folders compressed into a single file)
    * Package (folder)
        * Class (file)
            * Method
                * Statement                
{:.bold-list}

If a java statements are lines in a book, java Methods are paragraphs (or pages), a java Class is a book, a package is a bookshelf, and a java Library is a building (aka, a library!).

We'll get a closer look at how to work with classes and packages later.
