### Drive Team Personell
* Please let me know if you are interested in being a human player. Human players will need to get in a half hour of practice and we will go through a briefing of exactly what happens during the match. It can be learned quickly, but it does require the human player to move and react fairly quickly.
    * Sanvi, Sanjith, Pranav, Konark and Luke are all qualified already as they've done their training.
    * Hansini is on the interested list, and we'll get her some training time,
* Nathan and Aidan will continue to be driver/arm operator
* Sanvi/Sanjith/Luke are the team members I recall who practiced for being human player. We need one of these human players for practice on Thursday night
* Ishaan, Konark, Sanjith, Hanna are potential technicians (lifting and working on the robot)
