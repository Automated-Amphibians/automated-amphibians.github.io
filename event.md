## Food notes
(food schedule is above)

We will have limited water, please bring your own bottle.

### Pit Crew
* We hopefully will have a handout for basic robot information

### Transportation - Riding with another team member
**You can only provide transportation for other team members as an approved volunteer.**{: .important}

**To become an approved volunteer (who can give a ride), you must:**

* Email Ashley Bootz (ashley.bootz@novik12.org) with a copy of their driver's license, registration, and insurance.
* Fill out the [volunteer form](https://bit.ly/NCSDICHATLINK).

**To ride with another team member you must fill out the transportation waiver:**

* [Transportation Waiver](Transportation%20Waiver.pdf)

### Drive Team Personell
* Please let me know if you are interested in being a human player. Human players will need to get in a half hour of practice and we will go through a briefing of exactly what happens during the match. It can be learned quickly, but it does require the human player to move and react fairly quickly.
    * Sanvi, Sanjith, Pranav, Konark and Luke are all qualified already as they've done their training.
    * Hansini is on the interested list, and we'll get her some training time,
* Nathan and Aidan will continue to be driver/arm operator
* Sanvi/Sanjith/Luke are the team members I recall who practiced for being human player. We need one of these human players for practice on Thursday night
* Ishaan, Konark, Sanjith, Hanna are potential technicians (lifting and working on the robot)
