### Reality of Our Role
* Neutral facts 
    * Teams will be fighting for 4 points every single match, 2 minimum        
* The bad news
    * We on the bubble of a third pick
    * We don't have rep
    * We don't pick up off the ground
* The good news
    * Importance of roles have changed - being able to do both cubes/cones is a plus, some teams are heavy cone/cube
    * The weaker bots (that's us!) might be the ones balancing because the bots on the side should be hitting two or even three game pieces, which seperates the very strong from the merely good
        * Teams that can do left (15), right (15), center (21), will start off better 
        * Our auton is nice because it is over and back, a minor advantadge over *some* of the other third pick teams
    * We are pretty fast, heavy, nimble. We should be able to dodge or push opponents into the loading zone for a penalty - at this level, play will be aggressive        
    * A late third pick would actually be in our best interest

Our sales pitch:
* Good balance auton, reasonable side auton
* We will fill any scoring role, don't take up the feeder
* Reliable for 6-8 pieces
* Heavy but nimble, good ability to push lighter robots into penalty

* Unassigned team members: Sanvi, Rathul, Manasa, Ishaan
