Understands the entire programming stack, hardware (CPU + Memory + Cache + Interrupts + microcode), binary code, assembly, static and dynamic linking, compilation, interpretation, JIT compilation, garbage collection, heap, stack, memory addressing\u2026 Software Engineering Area Zero to no experience Intermediate Advanced Mastery Comments Source Code Management/Version Control Folder backups by date VSS and beginning CVS/SVN user Proficient in using CVS and SVN features. Knows how to branch and merge, use patches setup repository properties etc. Knowledge of distributed VCS systems. Has tried out Bzr/Mercurial/Darcs/Git Build Automation Only knows how to build from IDE Knows how to build the system from the command line Can setup a script to build the basic system Can setup a script to build the system and also documentation, installers, generate release notes and tag the code in source control Automated Testing Thinks that all testing is the job of the tester Has written automated unit tests and comes up with good unit test cases for the code that is being written Has written code in TDD manner Understands and is able to setup automated functional, load/performance and UI tests Programming Area Zero to no experience Intermediate Advanced Mastery Comments Problem Decomposition Only straight line code with copy paste for reuse Able to break up problem into multiple functions Able to come up with reusable functions/objects that solve the overall problem Use of appropriate data structures and algorithms and comes up with generic/object-oriented code that encapsulate aspects of the problem that are subject to change. Systems Decomposition Not able to think above the level of a single file/class Able to break up problem space and design solution as long as it is within the same platform/technology Able to design systems that span multiple technologies/platforms. Able to visualize and design complex systems with multiple product lines and integrations with external systems. Also should be able to design operations support systems like monitoring, reporting, fail overs etc. Communication Cannot express thoughts/ideas to peers. Poor spelling and grammar. Peers can understand what is being said. Good spelling and grammar. Is able to effectively communicate with peers Able to understand and communicate thoughts/design/ideas/specs in a unambiguous manner and adjusts communication as per the context This is an often under rated but very critical criteria for judging a programmer. With the increase in outsourcing of programming tasks to places where English is not the native tongue this issue has become more prominent. I know of several projects that failed because the programmers could not understand what the intent of the communication was. Code Organization Within a File no evidence of organization within a file Methods are grouped logically or by accessibility Code is grouped into regions and well commented with references to other source files File has license header, summary, well commented, consistent white space usage. The file should look beautiful. Code Organization Across Files No thought given to organizing code across files Related files are grouped into a folder Each physical file has a unique purpose, for e.g. one class definition, one feature implementation etc. Code organization at a physical level closely matches design and looking at file names and folder distribution provides insights into design Source Tree Organization Everything in one folder Basic separation of code into logical folders. No circular dependencies, binaries, libs, docs, builds, third-party code all organized into appropriate folders Physical layout of source tree matches logical hierarchy and organization. The directory names and organization provide insights into the design of the system. The difference between this and the previous item is in the scale of organization, source tree organization relates to the entire set of artifacts that define the system. Code Readability Mono-syllable names Good names for files, variables classes, methods etc. No long functions, comments explaining unusual code, bug fixes, code assumptions Code assumptions are verified using asserts, code flows naturally \u2013 no deep nesting of conditionals or methods Defensive Coding Doesn\u2019t understand the concept Checks all arguments and asserts critical assumptions in code Makes sure to check return values and check for exceptions around code that can fail. Has his own library to help with defensive coding, writes unit tests that simulate faults Error Handling Only codes the happy case Basic error handling around code that can throw exceptions/generate errors Ensures that error/exceptions leave program in good state, resources, connections and memory is all cleaned up properly Codes to detect possible exception before, maintain consistent exception handling strategy in all layers of code, come up with guidelines on exception handling for entire system. IDE Mostly uses IDE for text editing Knows their way around the interface, able to effectively use the IDE using menus. Knows keyboard shortcuts for most used operations. Has written custom macros API Needs to look up the documentation frequently Has the most frequently used APIs in memory Vast and In-depth knowledge of the API Has written libraries that sit on top of the API to simplify frequently used tasks and to fill in gaps in the API E.g. of API can be Java library, .net framework or the custom API for the application Frameworks Has not used any framework outside of the core platform Has heard about but not used the popular frameworks available for the platform. Has used more than one framework in a professional capacity and is well-versed with the idioms of the frameworks. Author of framework Requirements Takes the given requirements and codes to spec Come up with questions regarding missed cases in the spec Understand complete picture and come up with entire areas that need to be speced Able to suggest better alternatives and flows to given requirements based on experience Scripting No knowledge of scripting tools Batch files/shell scripts Perl/Python/Ruby/VBScript/Powershell Has written and published reusable code Database Thinks that Excel is a database Knows basic database concepts, normalization, ACID, transactions and can write simple selects Able to design good and normalized database schemas keeping in mind the queries that\u2019ll have to be run, proficient in use of views, stored procedures, triggers and user defined types.

Can do basic database administration, performance optimization, index optimization, write advanced select queries, able to replace cursor usage with relational sql, understands how data is stored internally, understands how indexes are stored internally, understands how databases can be mirrored, replicated etc. Understands how the two phase commit works.
