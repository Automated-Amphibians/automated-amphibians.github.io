[In 2022 the Automated Amphibians competed at Milford and Walled Lake events.](https://www.thebluealliance.com/team/8426/2022)

The 2022 season had it's challenges, but the Amphibians were up to the task. A small but dedicated group of rookie members worked to put together a reliable robot capable of putting points on the board, and climbing hitting the second level on the bars. 

This robot was based on the [everybot design](https://www.118everybot.org/).
