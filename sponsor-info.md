## Who we are:
Automated Amphibians are a competitive robotics team in the [First Robotics Competition (FRC) league](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc).

We peer with FRC team [503 Frog Force](https://frogforce503.org/), whose student and adult mentors help guide us in everything we do as well as providing some advanced services (practice field, CNC equipment) This helps to reduce our costs and gives us the ability to focus on the robot engineering.

## What makes us unique?

**Team 8426 is built entirely from 9th grade students with little to no robotics experience prior to High School.** For students that have a busy Fall/Spring schedule due to sports or other committments, we have a reduced up front commitment to outreach projects; However, we still are developing a targeted outreach program that is focused on developing engineering at a sister team at either the FLL, FTC or even FRC level. More to follow as 8426 continues to gain experience.

We focus on:
* Developing curiosity and instincts about making, software development, and engineering principals of robot building
* A hands on experience, primarily focused on engineering.
* Maintaining a minimum of 3:1 student to mentor ratio

Students will be challenged to learn STEM principals including coding, how to design and fabricate robot parts, and how a group of engineers coordinates a large project towards a single goal. 

A successful season with FRC 8426 isnâ€™t a grind towards an award. For us, a successful season is one that ends with students excited about pursuing deeper levels of mastery in robotics, stem, and academics.
